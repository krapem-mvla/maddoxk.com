					<h3 class="major">History</h3>
					<p>Huffman compression, invented by David A. Huffman in 1952, revolutionized data encoding
						through its innovative
						variable-length prefix coding system. Inspired by a challenge from his MIT professor,
						Huffman developed an algorithm
						that efficiently allocated shorter codes to more frequently occurring symbols. This
						groundbreaking technique drastically
						reduced the average code length for messages, transforming the digital landscape and
						becoming widely adopted in various
						applications.</p>
					<h3 class="major">How does compression work?</h3>
					<p>File compression is the process of reducing the size of a file to save disk space and make it
						easier to transfer. One
						popular method for file compression is to use character frequency analysis, which takes
						advantage of the fact that some
						characters appear more frequently in a file than others. By replacing frequently occurring
						characters with shorter
						codes, the overall size of the file can be reduced without losing any of the original
						information.</p>


					<h3 class="major">Implementation (Part 1: Compression/Encoding)</h3>
					<ul>
						<p>Weights in Huffman Compression refer to the frequencies of characters in the input data. The
							algorithm assigns shorter
							codes to more frequently occurring characters and longer codes to less frequent ones,
							resulting in an efficient
							compression scheme. To utilize a balanced tree, follow these steps:</p>
						<li>Determine the frequency (weight) of each character in the input data. <b>Characters with
								more frequency have more "Weight"</b></li>
						<li>Create a leaf node for each character and add it to a priority queue based on its frequency.
						</li>
						<li>While there is more than one node in the queue, remove the two nodes with the lowest
							frequencies.</li>
						<li>Create a new internal node with the sum of the two removed nodes' frequencies as its weight.
							This new node becomes the
							parent of the removed nodes.</li>
						<li>Insert the new internal node back into the priority queue.</li>
						<li>Repeat steps 3-5 until there is only one node left in the queue, which becomes the root of
							the balanced Huffman tree.</li>
						<li>Traverse the tree from the root to each leaf node, assigning a binary code (0 or 1) to each
							edge along the path. The
							final code for each character is the sequence of edge codes followed from the root to the
							corresponding leaf node.</li>
					</ul>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Huffman_huff_demo.gif" alt="" /></a>
					<p>The following code successfully reads an ASCII file and produces the weights:</p>
					<pre><code>void generateWeights(String infName) {
// Open the input file
File inf = fio.getFileHandle(infName);
int status = fio.getFileStatus(inf, true);

// Make sure file is readable
if(readErrorCheck(status)) return;

// reset weights
initWeights();
BufferedReader br = fio.openBufferedReader(inf);
int c = 0;
	try {
		// Read the input file one character at a time until EOF
		while ((c = br.read()) != -1) {
			try {
				weights[c]++;
			} catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
			// Ignore the character if it is not in the ASCII range
			}
		}
		// Increment the count for the EOF character
		weights[0]++;
		br.close();
	} catch (IOException e) {
		e.printStackTrace();
	}
	outf = fio.getFileHandle(infName + ".csv");
	saveWeightsToFile(outf.getName());
}</code></pre>
					<p>The following code successfully takes the weights and file and builds a huffman tree</p>
					<pre><code>
/**
* Builds the huffman tree. Make sure to:
* 1) initialize root to null (cleanup any prior conversions)
* 2) re-initialize the encodeMap
* 3) initialize the queue
* 4) build the tree:
* while the queue is not empty:
* pop the head of the queue into the left HuffmanTreeNode.
* if the queue is empty - set root = left, and return;
* pop the head of the queue into the right HuffmanTreeNode
* create a new non-leaf HuffmanTreeNode whose children are left and right,
* and whose weight is the sum of the weight of the left and right children
* add the new node back to the queue.
*
* It is assumed that the weights have been initialized prior
* to calling this method.
*
* @param minimize - This is just passed to the method to initialize the queue.

					<h3 class="major">Implementation (Part 2: Uncompression/Decoding)</h3>
					<p>
						The main objective is to restore the original data from the compressed version. Here's an
						overview of how
						Huffman decompression
						works:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							Retrieve the Huffman tree: To decode a Huffman compressed file, you need the same Huffman
							tree that was used during the
							compression process. This tree is typically stored at the beginning of the compressed file,
							allowing the decompression
							algorithm to reconstruct the tree.
						</li>
						<li>
							Traverse the Huffman tree: Start at the root node of the Huffman tree. Read the compressed
							binary data bit by bit. If
							the bit is 0, move to the left child node, and if it's 1, move to the right child node.
						</li>
						<li>
							Identify the character: Continue traversing the tree based on the bits in the compressed
							data until you reach a leaf
							node, which represents a character in the original data. Append the character to the output.
						</li>
						<li>
							Repeat the process: Go back to the root node of the Huffman tree and continue reading the
							compressed binary data,
							traversing the tree, and appending characters to the output until you reach the end of the
							compressed data.
						</li>
						<li>
							Terminate the output: Some implementations use an End-of-File (EOF) marker to signal the end
							of the compressed data.
							When the EOF marker is encountered, the algorithm stops and the decompressed data is
							complete.
						</li>
					</ul>





					<h3 class="major">Key Takeaways</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Importance of data compression: Huffman compression is a widely used lossless data
							compression algorithm that highlights
							the significance of efficient data storage and transmission.</li>


						<li>Adaptive nature: The algorithm adapts to the input data, creating a unique Huffman tree and
							encoding for each file,
							which optimizes compression based on the frequency of characters in the data.</li>


						<li>Lossless compression: Huffman compression ensures that no information is lost during the
							process, allowing for accurate
							reconstruction of the original data during decompression.</li>


						<li>Binary tree structure: The use of a binary tree (Huffman tree) is a key aspect of this
							algorithm, as it enables
							efficient encoding and decoding of data.</li>


						<li>Greedy approach: Huffman coding employs a greedy algorithm, where the most frequent
							characters are assigned the shortest
							codes, resulting in optimal compression.</li>


						<li>Broad applications: Huffman compression is applicable in various fields, such as image and
							audio compression, text
							compression, and in some cases, network protocols like HTTP/2.</li>


						<li>Learning experience: Implementing Huffman compression and decompression algorithms provides
							valuable experience in
							understanding data structures, algorithms, and programming concepts.</li>
