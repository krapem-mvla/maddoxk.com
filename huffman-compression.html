					<h3 class="major">How does compression work?</h3>
					<p>File compression is the process of reducing the size of a file to save disk space and make it
						easier to transfer. One
						popular method for file compression is to use character frequency analysis, which takes
						advantage of the fact that some
						characters appear more frequently in a file than others. By replacing frequently occurring
						characters with shorter
						codes, the overall size of the file can be reduced without losing any of the original
						information.</p>
					<p>Steps for Huffman Compression</p>
					<ul>
						<li>UniverseState</li>
						<p>Since this simulation was technically built inside a game engine, we need a class to take
							care of the current state of the universe. These are things like the camera, windows, gui,
							time, gravitational constant, etc.</p>
						<li>UniverseManager</li>
						<p>This class is used a to compute and update the state of the universe. It also stores the
							ArrayLists of celestial bodies and updates them.</p>
						<li>CelestialBody</li>
						<p>The most essential class. This classes purpose is to be used as an object to store a body's
							mass, velocity, and geometry.</p>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<h3 class="major">Simulating Gravity</h3>
					<p>Simulating a universe with gravity can be done using one formula: Newton's law of universal
						gravitation.</p>
					<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/gravity_equation.svg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>Converting this formula into code can also be quite simple. I've done this by iterating through
						the ArrayList of celestial bodies and calculating the total effect of gravitational pull from
						each body on eachother. As seen in code here:</p>
					<pre><code>for (CelestialBody other : allBodies) {
	if (other != this) {
		Vector3f direction = other.getGeometry().getLocalTranslation().subtract(this.getGeometry().getLocalTranslation());
		<b>Vector3f force = direction.mult(UniverseState.G * other.getMass() / direction.lengthSquared()); // Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation </b>
		Vector3f acceleration = force.divide(this.getMass());
		this.currentVelocity = this.currentVelocity.add(acceleration.mult(timeStep));
	}
}</code></pre>

					<h4>Deep Dive</h4>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/finalv1.gif"></span>
						Here is the first example instance of me getting gravity to work. There is initaly 3 bodies with
						similar mass but different
						starting postitions and velocity. Tweaking with some numbers, this was able to produce two
						bodies that dance together as a binary pair and the other body to orbit them.
						This is whats know as an "circumbinary system" and is pretty cool to watch. If you'd like to
						create your own, id highly recommend it as this teached me multiple valuable learning lessons in
						my software engineering journey. Next, you can try to experiment with different starting
						positions, velocities, and masses for the bodies in your
						simulation. This will allow you to see how different initial conditions affect the final outcome
						of the simulation. You
						can also try adjusting the gravitational constant to see how it affects the motion of the
						bodies.
						You can also try simulating more complex scenarios, such as a system of multiple planets
						orbiting a star or a galaxy
						with multiple stars. These types of simulations can be quite challenging to create, but they can
						also be very rewarding.
						As you continue to develop your gravity simulator, you can also research and read about the
						latest advances in the field
						of celestial mechanics. This will help you to better understand the physics behind your
						simulation and to improve its
						accuracy. Overall, developing a gravity simulator can be a fun and educational experience, and
						can also be a great way to learn
						about the complexities of the universe. Specifically, how difficult it is to get planets to
						orbit.</p>

						On the right is one of my final versions of my simulator. This includes various controls for
						things like time, gravity, camera, and options to create custom celestial bodies.
